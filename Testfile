Let me explain a few more things you'll see:
Issues: A place to track bugs, tasks, or ideas

Click the "Issues" tab
Click "New issue" to create a to-do item or report a problem

Stars: You can "star" repositories you like (like bookmarking)

When you visit other people's repositories, click the "Star" button to save them

Fork: Makes a complete copy of someone else's repository to your account

Useful when you want to experiment with someone else's project

Clone: Downloads a repository to your computer

We'll learn this when we install Git on your computer
