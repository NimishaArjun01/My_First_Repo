# My First GitHub Project

Hello! This is my first repository on GitHub.

I'm learning about:
- Creating repositories
- Editing files
- Making commits

## What I'll build next
I'm excited to learn more about version control!

## Experimental Section
This text is only in my experiment branch!
I'm testing how branches work.
